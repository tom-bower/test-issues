## Issues

Before filing a new issue, search through open/closed tickets.  

#### Code related Issues
Non-security related issues can be handled by creating a new ticket.
When you create a new issue, be explicit. Include an example coupled with a code snippet and any related information (i.e. operating system type, python version  etc.).

Be kind to the maintainers, clear and concise information results in a faster patch.

To open an new (i.e. unreported issue) [Open an issue](https://github.com/weaver-lab/py-wiremq/issues/new).  

#### Security related Issues
For `security issues`, please do not publicly disclose the issue without contacting the maintainers first. See the following guide for proper security related bug disclosure [here](TBD) (tbd)

## Code Contributions

Try to provide (py)tests when you can - they can be found in the project repositories parent directory. Documentation and examples can be found [here](https://pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html).

Adhere to `coding styles` outlined [here](https://github.com/weaver-lab/py-wiremq/blob/develop/docs/developerdocs/guides/CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md). Our views on resolving common `git workflow` problems can be found [here]((https://github.com/weaver-lab/py-wiremq/blob/develop/docs/developerdocs/guides/GIT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md))

Doing this is not a stringent requirement, although, contributions adhering to the style are helpful to maintainers and newcomers.

All code contributed is and will be [MIT Licensed](../LICENSE).
